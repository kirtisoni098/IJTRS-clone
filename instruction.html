        <p>International Journal of Technical Research & Science (Published by: Institute of Technical and Scientific Research) is having ISSN 2454-2024 (online), monthly international journal, being published every month by Institute of Technical and Scientific
            Research India.

            <br><br> It is academic, peer reviewed, online, open access (full paper) international journal. It aims to publish original, theoretical and practical advances in technical research, science and management. All the submitted papers will be
            reviewed and select by the board of committee of IJTRS.

            <br><br> The aim of the journal is to disseminate original, scientific, theoretical or applied research in the field of Engineering and allied fields, to dispense a platform for publishing results and research with a strong empirical component,
            to aqueduct the significant gap between research and practice by promoting the publication of original, novel, industry-relevant research, to seek original and unpublished research papers based on theoretical or experimental works for the
            publication globally, to publish original, theoretical and practical advances in MElectrical Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science Engineering, Forestry Engineering,
            Food Engineering, Water Resource Engineering, Biotechnology Engineering, Architecture & Planning, Aerospace Engineering, Bio Mechanical& Biomedical Engineering, Geo Technical Engineering, Gas Engineering, Geological Engineering, Production
            Engineering, Forensic Engineering, Nanotechnology, Environmental Science, General Science, Education, Economics, Management, Human Resources & Many More, to impart a platform for publishing results and research with a strong empirical component,
            to create a bridge for significant gap between research and practice by promoting the publication of original, novel, industry-relevant research, to solicit original and unpublished research papers, based on theoretical or experimental works.

            <br><br>Papers for the journal can be submitted, round the year, electronically at <a href="mailto:ijtrseditor@gmail.com">ijtrseditor@gmail.com</a>. After the final acceptance of the paper and with the detailed review by the review committee,
            the paper will be published online. However, the research paper for the specific volume/ issue will be taken by editorial board later. For Theme Based Special Issues, time bound Special Call for Papers will be announced and the same will be
            applicable for that specific issue only.

            <br><br>Submission implies that the work done is original and not published prior in any publication elsewhere.(except in the form of an abstract or academic thesis). The submission should be approved by all the authors and if accepted the
